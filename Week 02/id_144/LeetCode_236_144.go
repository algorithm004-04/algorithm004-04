 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given
 * nodes in the tree.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
 * is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
 * and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * 
 * Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant
 * of itself according to the LCA definition.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
 * p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
